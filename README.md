# Rachel's Portfolio
This project was created as a portfolio website for graphic designer Rachel Lattanzi.

Current state: Three template files that will be edited as needed for individual projects.

Future Goals:
Convert the templates into Go and make them dynamic. 
Allow for an admin view so Rachel can change/add/delete website elements as needed.
